**PROS**

+  Speedy: Most short video files are downloaded almost instantly. As soon as you click "Download," a message pops up telling you the process is complete. You can then play the video immediately, or return to your browser to find more clips

+  Browser integration: Since this app integrates with your browser, it can automatically detect when a downloadable file is present on a Web page and inserts a Download button onto the page. All you have to do is click the button and enter a description to begin the downloading process
